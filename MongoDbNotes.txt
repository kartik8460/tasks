$size does not support comparision or logical operator (only a numeric value)
$not also returns the document in which the field does not exists
In projection if you want to exclude nested document fields then you cannot exlude main documents fields
In projection _id is default set to 1 we have to explicitly set it to 0 if we want to exclude it from the result
If we search for null value for a particular field of the documents it will also return those documents in which that field doest not exist
